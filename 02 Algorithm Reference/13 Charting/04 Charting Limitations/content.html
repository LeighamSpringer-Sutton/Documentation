	Intensive charting generates hundreds of megabytes (200MB) of data which is far too much to stream online or display in a web browser. Because of this we limit the number of points a chart can have to 4000. If you see an error <code>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped</code> you have hit this limit and should reduce your sampling frequency.
